    "content":"Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.Flask provides configuration and conventions, with sensible defaults, to get started. This section of the documentation explains the different parts of the Flask framework and how they can be used, customized, and extended. Beyond Flask itself, look for community-maintained extensions to add even more functionality.Use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your project, both in development and in production.What problem does a virtual environment solve? The more Python projects you have, the more likely it is that you need to work with different versions of Python libraries, or even Python itself. Newer versions of libraries for one project can break compatibility in another project.Virtual environments are independent groups of Python libraries, one for each project. Packages installed for one project will not affect other projects or the operating system's packages.Python comes bundled with the venv module to create virtual environments.",
